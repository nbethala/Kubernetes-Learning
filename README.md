# Kubernetes-Learning
This repository is a structured resource for exploring and mastering Kubernetes. It provides practical examples, hands-on manifests, and clear explanations of essential concepts such as Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and resource management. Whether youâ€™re just starting your Kubernetes journey or looking to deepen your understanding of advanced topics, this repository is designed to support both learning and experimentation in a real-world context.

"kubectl create"- it creates a new resource based on the provided configuration file.If the resource already exists, kubectl create will return an error, indicating that the resource already exists.
It's typically used for creating resources that don't already exist in the cluster.

"kubectl apply" - is used to create or update resources based on the provided configuration file. If the resource already exists, kubectl apply will update the existing resource with the new configuration. 

kubectl apply is idempotent, i.e., we can apply the same configuration multiple times, and it will ensure that the resource is in the desired state. It's commonly used for both creating new resources and updating existing ones.

# CKA - Concepts to master
## Docker Architecture
## Kubernetes Architecture
     - Master/Control plane Node V/s Worker Node ( Node is nothing but a Virtual machine)
     - ApiServer :- Client interacts with the cluster using ApiServer
     - Scheduler: decide which pod to be scheduled on which node based on different factors
     - Controller Manager
     - ETCD Server - Key value database that stores the cluster state and configuration
     - Kubelet - Node-level agent that helps container management and receives instructions from Api server
     - Kube proxy - Pod to pod communication
     - Install Kubectl
     - Install single node kind-cluster
     
## Creating a Kubernetes object
     - Imperative way ( Through command or API calls)
     - Declarative way ( By creating manifest files)

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/ (cheatsheet for kubernetes commands)
- What is a Replica Set : https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/
- What is a Deployment : https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/
- What is a Replication Controller : https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/
  
## Kubernetes Services:  
   Different applications communicate with each other within Kubernetes using a service; it is also used to access applications outside the cluster.
  There are 4 types of Services:
     - ClusterIP(For Internal access) 
     - NodePort(To access the application on a particular port)
     - LoadBalancer(To access the application on a domain name or IP address without using the port number)
     - External (To use an external DNS for routing)

 ## What is a Namespace in Kubernetes
     - Provides isolation of resources
     - Avoid accidental deletion/modification
     - Separated by resource type or environment or domain and so on
     - Resources can access each other in the same namespace with their first name by the DNS name for other namespaces    

 ## Multi Container Pod Kubernetes
      - Sidecar vs Init Container

 ## Kubernetes Daemonset,Job and Cronjob
 What is a daemonset?
 A daemon set is another type of Kubernetes object that controls pods. Unlike deployment, the DS automatically deploys 1 pod to each available node. You don't need to  update the replica based on demand; the DS takes care of it by spinning X number of pods for X number of nodes.
  
 If you create a ds in a cluster of 5 nodes, then 5 pods will be created. 
 If you add another node to the cluster, a new pod will be automatically created on the new node.
 
### Examples of daemonset
    kube-proxy
    calico - Networking CNI 
    flannel - Networking CNI 
    weave-net
    monitoring agents etc
